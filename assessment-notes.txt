The runtime results of the two functions show that the Append/push function scales better in regards to scale.  With the smaller arrays the Insert/unshift does have a quicker run time but as soon has the array get larger it start to slow down.  This is because with unshift it is creating a new array each time it runs and putting our new number in the front of the array.
